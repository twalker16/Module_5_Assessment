Imagine you are opening a pet adoption agency where you will rescue and care for animals and try to find them owners who are a good match for them.

Design a database with at least 4 tables for your pet adoption agency. Include any relationships between tables where you feel they are needed.

For example, youâ€™ll need an animals table. Perhaps you have an animal species table as well. The relationship between animal species and animals is one-to-many. For every one species in the species table, you could, at most, have many animals of that species in the animals table.

Submit a diagram of your database for this project.
